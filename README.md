## Hi and welcome! I'm audrey.

A first-year undergrad at MIT, originally from Palo Alto, CA. Currently at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in the [Health 0.0 group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/health-0-0/overview/), where I'm developing Bayesian deep learning models to quantify uncertainty in image segmentation probelms.
