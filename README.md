# Hi and welcome! I'm audrey.

I'm a first-year undergrad at MIT, originally from Palo Alto, CA. Currently at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in the [Health 0.0 group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/health-0-0/overview/), where I'm interested in modeling uncertainty for deep learning.
